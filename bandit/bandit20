# In this one you have to set up a two processed A and B. First on 
# A run the command:
nc -l -p 12345
# This listens on port 12345.
# Then on B run:
./suconnect 12345
# This gets B to connect to A
# Next on A paste in the password from last time. Then B will hear 
# this and respond with the next password

# To set up two processes you can either use tmux or have two jobs
# running on the same shell and switch between them with bg and fg.
