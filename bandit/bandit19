# This one is a little weird. I spent ages trying to run "setuid" in bash
# That is not the way! A setuid binary is one that has the 'setuid' bit set to on.
# This means that anyone with permission to execute the file does so with the
# permissions of the UserID. Similarly you can set the 'setgid' bit to make it
# so that anyone who can execute the file does so with the privileges of the group.
# To set these bits use chmod 4000 and chmod 2000 respectively.
